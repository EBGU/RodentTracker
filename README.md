This toolkit includes three major part.

First, it converts videos into sequential images for downstream processings. It would also correct images based on four key points you choose.

Second, it would remove the background of each image. You can either choose the background to be the average frame of the video, or the average frame of the first ten seconds of the video. It is not neccessary if you have a clean background.

Finally, it could track the centroid of the animal.
